# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **unsupervised learning** techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior. By leveraging **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, the model helps businesses understand customer preferences, improve marketing strategies, and enhance customer experiences.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 Features
✔️ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
✔️ Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (PCA)  
✔️ Clustering using K-Means algorithm  
✔️ Interpretation of customer segments  

## 📊 Results
The project provides **insights into customer behaviors**, allowing businesses to tailor marketing campaigns and personalize user experiences effectively.
